Wheather I am playing these sports, will play these sports, or have played these sports these are my 3 favorite sports
<h2>In my entire educational carrer I have only played 3 sports and only did I find interest into these sports when I was in 8th grade. </h2>
<h1>What is cross country?</h1>
<h3>Cross country is simply long distance running over all sorts of terrains and conditions. A simple sport but there is more to it then just running</h3>
<h1>What is Track?</h1>
<h3>Track is also distance running but also includes short distance sprinting, throwing, and other athletic things that would not be its own sport normally but in track there are multiple activities on or around a track</h3>
<h1>What is Swimming?</h1>
<h3>Obviously you are swimming for this sport but there is lots of teqnique and physical obsticals to become better there are many rules and tradition</h3>
